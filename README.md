# Etch A Sketch (EAS)

This project is a web-based "Etch A Sketch" drawing application built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Features

- Interactive drawing grid that supports different grid sizes.
- Drawing modes: Black & White or Colored.
- "Dissappearing" mode for hover-drawn fading effects.
- Clear grid functionality.
- Dynamic and responsive layout with left and right sidebars.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser.

### Running Locally

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aayusht200/EAS.git
   cd EAS
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

That's it! You should see the Etch A Sketch UI.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` — Main HTML file that loads the app.
- `index.js` — Contains all application logic, UI creation, and event handling.
- `index.css` — Styles for layout and components.

## How It Works

- The app creates a central drawing grid and two sidebars.
- You can select grid size, drawing mode, clear the grid, or enable "Dissappearing" mode.
- Drawing is performed by hovering over grid cells.

## Customization

- Edit `index.js` to add new features or change grid logic.
- Adjust styles in `index.css` as needed.
